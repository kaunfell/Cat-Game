Cat game


I wanted to make a simple game using kaboom.js. 

Kaboom intro from the web site, Youtube and bit of Github Copilot were 
used in this project.




Things to improve:

-sprites and backgrounds 
-make cat walking gif work
-landing cat sprite should stay longer
-when moving, the cat sprite color should change (now the sprite stays there for a moment and disappears on purpose)
-mouse spawn to be better, so there would not be so many sometimes
-when scored high enough, it would be possible to go to another round
